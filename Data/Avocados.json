Mix the imitation crabmeat with mayonnaise in a bowl, and set aside. To roll the sushi, cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap. With wet fingers, firmly pat a thin, even layer of prepared rice over the nori, leaving 1/4 inch uncovered at the bottom edge of the sheet.

Once the sushi is rolled, wrap it in the mat and gently squeeze to compact it tightly. 5. Cut each roll into 1 inch pieces with a very sharp knife dipped in water.",
