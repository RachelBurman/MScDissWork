Strain olive oil into the breadcrumbs and mix to combine to create garlic crumbs. Allow garlic crumbs to cool. 3. Cut the steak into two (8-pounce) portions. Place one of the steaks onto a piece of plastic wrap and fold wrap over to cover meat. Pound with a tenderizer or another heavy object to 1/4 inch thickness. Repeat with the second steak. 4. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. 5. Spoon cooled garlic crumb over the flattened steak to cover the surface up to the edges. Fold over plastic wrap and pound again to drive garlicky breadcrumbs into the steak. Flip steak over and repeat process on the other side. 6. Heat remaining 2 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add steak and cook until meat starts to sizzle, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook about 2 minutes per side for medium to medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 to140 degrees F (54 to 60 degrees C).",

  "directions": "1. Combine 3/4 of the flour, egg, olive oil, salt, and water in a bowl. Mix with a fork, just like when making a pasta dough, until ingredients just come together. Continue mixing everything with your hands into a shaggy dough. Turn out mixture onto a floured surface and keep kneading until dough is nice and smooth. Add additional flour as needed. Cover and allow dough to rest on the counter for 30 minutes. 2. Combine ground beef, onion, parsley, smoked paprika, kosher salt, pepper, and Armenian cayenne in a bowl. Mix with a fork at first, then use your hands until filling is well combined. Cover and chill in the refrigerator. 3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees C (200 degrees C). Grease a cast-iron skillet with olive oil. 4. Lightly flour a work surface and set the dough on top. Cut dough in half and roll out one half as thin as possible into a large rectangle. Cut dough first into strips, then into 20 small rectangles, about 1.5 x 1.75 inches each. Reserve dough scraps in case there is left over filling to make extra manti. Repeat with second half. 5. Use a teaspoon to portion out the filling, about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon per manti, and set into the middle of each dough rectangle (you can also use your hands to portion out the filling as shown in the video). 6. Moisten the outer, shorter edges of each rectangle with a little bit of water on your fingertips, pick up a rectangle, and trap the filling inside by pinching both ends of the dough together, creating the classic \"little man in the boat\" design. Press dumpling together so manti will sit up straight in the skillet, making sure the dough at the ends is as thin as it is around the filling. 7. Set manti inside the prepared skillet in such a way that there is still a little room between the dumplings as the dough will expand to about twice its size during cooking. 8. Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 40 minutes. 9. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat and cook garlic until fragrant, 20 to 30 seconds. Add tomato sauce and stir quickly. Add chicken broth and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. 10. Bring tomato broth to a simmer and turn off the heat. 11. Ladle tomato broth over the manti and return to the oven for 15 more minutes.",

You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt. 4. Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.

Set thermocirculator to 128 degrees F (53 degrees C) and allow water bath to come up to temperature. 2. While water heats, trim excess fat from the fat cap of the brisket to about 1/4 inch. Do not remove all the fat, as this will contribute to keeping the meat juicy. Pat brisket dry with a paper towel. 3. Combine salt, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika and pepper in a small bowl. Completely cover all sides of the brisket with the spice mixture. 4. Place the brisket in a large vacuum sealable bag. Seal bag according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer vacuum sealed brisket to warm water bath with thermocirculator, cover vessel with aluminum foil to reduce evaporation, and cook undisturbed for 48 hours. Remove brisket from bag, reserving cooking liquid (you should have about 3 ½ cups cooking liquid). Strain cooking liquid through a fine mesh sieve and discard any solids. Set brisket aside on a plate or cutting board. 5. Place dried ancho chiles in a large, dry saucepan over medium high heat. Cook, turning often, until chiles are blistered, and aromatic. Remove chiles from heat and allow to cool briefly. Once chiles have cooled enough to handle, remove stems and seeds, and tear chiles into 2-inch pieces. Place torn chiles in a medium bowl with 1 cup of boiling water and 2 cups of strained, reserved cooking liquid; allow to stand until chiles have softened, about 10 minutes. 6. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in the same saucepan over medium-high heat.

Combine softened chiles, 1/2 cup reserved liquid, onion mixture, and ketchup in a blender; blend until smooth. Add unsalted butter and sherry vinegar to the mixture and process until smooth. If you want a spicier sauce, add cayenne pepper or hot sauce to taste. 8. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high (350 degrees F to 400 degrees F / 175 degrees C to 200 degrees C). 9. Pat brisket dry with paper towels and rub with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place on the preheated grill and grill until grill marks appear, the outside is slightly charred, and the brisket is heated through, about 5 minutes per side. 10.
